# fantasy-game-2024
Possible TSA Video Game entry for 2024 by Skyline High School.

### Current team members:
- Luca DalCanto (Manager, Developer, Programmer, Sound Engineer)
- Calvin Webb (Developer, Programmer, Animator, 3D Artist, Designer)
- Jeffery Zou (Developer, Programmer,  Writer, Designer)
- Connor Soelberg (Developer, GUI Designer, 2D Artist)
- Micah Tien (Developer, Programmer, Designer)

### Possible game ideas: (add to the list as we go)

- 3D game with Calvin as primary artists
- Running map that connects the world with "levels" in contrasting biomes (or, you know, we could have open world which is 100x harder)
- Level selection on globe
- World is a small island with biomes and untapped secrets that must be explored
- Whole thing is actually at sea
- The world is based around music and maybe magic associated with music (Luca could be in charge of audio)
- Include some twist on your normal adventure game, like the protagonist is a monster being chased by a hero or the game tells a story of defeat rather than victory.

### Theoretical Timeline of Progress:

September: Basic Dev Assets are in manufacturing, including music, 3d models, and UI. A rough story outline and basic world/levels map of biomes is near completition. <br>
October: Basic assets complete, specific ones in manufacturing. Basic storyline is complete with specific dialog and locations being fletched out. Unity project is underway with a rough world map.<br>
Novemeber: Basic menu navigation is complete and parts of the world are filled with assets. More specific assets still in development.<br>
December: Storyline is taking shape within the project and assets are being upgraded.<br>
January: World is continuing to be built and specific events such as boss fights are being produced.<br>
February: Game has taken shape and small details such as audio and lighting are perfected. By mid-February we're in code-freeze and enter beta testing/debugging. Write up necassary documentation.<br>
Submit project early March.
