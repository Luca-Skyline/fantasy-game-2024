# fantasy-game-2024
Possible TSA Video Game entry for 2024 by Skyline High School.

Current team members: Luca DalCanto, Calvin Webb, Micah Tien, Jeffery Zou.

Possible game ideas: (add to the list as we go)

- 3D game with Calvin as primary artists
- alternative, we do 2d pixel art
- Running map that connects the world with "levels" in contrasting biomes (or, you know, we could have open world which is 100x harder)
- The world is based around music and maybe magic associated with music (Luca could be in charge of audio)
- Include some twist on your normal adventure game, like the protagonist is a monster being chased by a hero or the game tells a story of defeat rather than victory.
