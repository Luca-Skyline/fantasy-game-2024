# Dragon Story Arc and Mechanics

## Idea 1: Dragonscape Chronicles (to be renamed)
A lost wyrmling must set out on a mighty adventure to escape the humans who destroyed his home and threaten all of Dragon kind. Along the way he faces a number of challenges that allow him to discover new abilities, giving him a fighting chance at survival in the frightening new world. Along the way he's reminded time and again the blind cruelty of the humans who can't seem to look past our poor Dragon's outer self, and at his lowest point finds he may be the only dragon left in all the world. With his loss of childlike innocence comes a loss of his childhood, and by the end of the game he's taking flight no longer as a wyrmling but instead as the fabled Bahamut, a mythical hero fabled to restore dragon kind.

### Beginning
A young wyrmling named Yldra was sent out by his mother to gather _something_ and is on his way home. This is the opening scene - Yldra flying low above the **forest** biome. He then descends into his mother's "lair" / cave and enters. His mother is in there, bathing in the pool system that fills their cave (this is done to reduce the necassary modeling and animation for this character, as we can have a head poking out of the pool). However, there's some unexpected guests that followed Yldra - he must not have been quite careful enough when he was out and about.

A hunting party of two dozen adventurers, ever thirsty for dragon treasure fill the chamber. Knowing that she must protect her son, his mother tells him "Go, Yldra! Get out through the back tunnel and fly to the **tallest peak in a world of a fire**. There's a friend there, and you'll be safe. I'll find you there." (a reference to the volcano biome (see below). On his way out of the cave though, he encounters a heroic adventurer from the land of men known named Stragnar Lightningmore. The player is given a short tutorial on their character as they enter combat with Stragnar but inevitably loses for the player has little in the way of the power or might. He is able to escape, but barely. He finds a place to hide nearby and waits to see his mother defeat the party, but agonizing roars are not a good a sign. Not long after the flashes of his mother's breath weapon subside, the band of adverturers emerge from the cave and he flies off into the night, hoping the injury on his wing does not worsen.
