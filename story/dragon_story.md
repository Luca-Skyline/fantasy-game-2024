# Of Hearth and Desolation, 2023-2024

Synopsis:
A lost wyrmling must set out on a mighty adventure to escape the humans who destroyed his home and threaten all of Dragon kind. Along the way they face a number of challenges that allow them to discover new abilities, giving them a fighting chance at survival in the frightening new world. Along the way they're reminded time and again the blind cruelty of the humans who can't seem to look past our poor Dragon's outer self, and at their lowest point finds they may be the only dragon left in all the world. With their loss of childlike innocence comes a newfound adulthood, and by the end of the game they're taking flight no longer as a wyrmling but instead as the fabled Bahamut, a mythical hero fabled to restore dragon kind.

## Biomes

Every corner of the world was once inhabited by its own "breed" of dragon. Each of the different dragons possessed different powers. For instance, the red dragons had the power of fire and were the mightiest of dragons, as well as the most agreeable and peaceful. The dragons preferred to distance each other from those of other types. Because of their innate ties to nature, the very presence of a dragon would reform the environment within a certain radius of its lair and therefore the world took on a number of flavors and contrasting biomes called the Dragonscape. There are dark days ahead though, and the humans are evolving quickly. Nature - the Dragonscape itself - and its symbiotic relationship with the dragons is being poisoned and destroyed. Plus, for the first time ever, humans stand a chance at destroying the dragons like they've done for so many species before. New technology, new magic, and worst of all a newfound ambition for dragon treasure are all driving the humans to be more ambitous than ever.

#### Forest:
This is the biome where the game starts, and also the ending one. At the beginning of the game this is a lush green forest, beatiful but also dangerous. It's a land sacred to the Dragons that is owned and protetected by the Purple dragons. The purple dragons are often forgotten, as they possess no elemental breath weapon like the other species. Instead, purple dragons are known for their incredible roar and their valuable adamantine horns. They are known to be the weakest of dragons, and survive primarily by being hidden and working in groups. Purple dragons are the ones you'd most commonly see interacting with dragons of other colors as well.

Though it may start as a lush green forest, by the end of the game its from that. When you return home at the end, the forest is dead and withering. Without Dragon protectors to look after it, it seems the humans are killing the world.

Forest Encounters/locations:
- Opening scene and tutorial
- 1st boss fight with a larger predator (mostly a doding to puzzle to escape while injured)
- 1st health buff and XP (no breath weapon yet!), allows wing to heal and dragon to leave forest biome
- "Secret Lake" scene, where Yldra recieves wisdom from an old tree and must prove himself (and learn) by fighting water elemental
- At least one party of wilderness travelers
- Closing scene after rest of biomes are explored

Adjacent biomes:
- Tundra
- Grasslands
- Human Empire

#### Grasslands:
Home to the Green dragons of poison. Green dragons are the greedy, witty, and stealthy ones who value treasure the most of any dragon. They are burrowers who make their lairs deep underground and love setting traps and puzzles to get inside. The ancient green dragon who once dwelled here was named Throrn. They were killed by the humans, but their lair is still there and within it their immortal dragon soul. 

Grasslands Encounters/locations:
- Mysterious puzzle engraving that covers the grasslands (grants XP)
- Traveling party of soldiers (combat!)
- Wizard tower
  - Can recieve lore and foreshadowing
  - Fun combat or possibly some puzzling/skill playing
- Green dragon lair
  - Boss fight with mummified mage from the tower.
  - Recieves poison breath weapon (a piece of wisom handed down from Thorn) and massive health buff
 
Adjacent Biomes:
- Forest
- Mountains
- Gulf
- Tundra
- Human Empire

#### Human Empire:
Completely walled off on all sides and protected by guards, this empire stands as an imposing threat. Though the player may chose to launch an attack on the empire at any point, this ultimately ends in defeat. The point of the Human Empire is basically to emphasize the superiority of the human race over individual dragons.

Adjacent Biomes:
- Tundra
- Forest
- Grasslands

#### Mountains:
Home to the Blue dragons of lightning. Blue dragons are brutes. They love flying, they love lightning, and what they lack in intelligence is made up in strength. The mountains are filled with a mist, making it hard to see far ahead. They're also filled with dangers lurking around every corner (lots of combat here). The ancient blue dragon who once dwelled here was named Kintravran. They were killed by the humans, but their lair is still there and within it their immortal dragon soul. 

Mountain Encounters/locations:
- Lots of combat
- Lore written into the rock
- Occasional river of lava, with some creative task to cross it
- Blue Dragon Lair
  - Boss fight with beast of Calvin's choice
  - Recieves lightning breath weapon (a piece of wisdom handed down from Kintravran) and massive health buff
 
Adjacent Biomes:
- Gulf
- Grasslands
- Volcano

#### Tundra:
Home to the White dragons of ice. White dragons are cold and dark, they're highly religous and prophetic, and they've got a knack for saying a lot while saying nothing at all. The ancient dragon ancestor who lived here was named Frostfang. They were killed by the humans, but tehir lair is still there and within it their immortal dragon soul. 

Tundra enounters/locations:
- Long journeys and paths with natural enemies and dead ends (as well as mysterious lore written in places)
- Human outposts, at high elevations, that launch rocks at you.
- Haunted ghost colony
- Psuedodragon colony (off-bread small dragon humanoids) that is suffering at the hands of the humans and must be saved/relocated to a nearby location
- White dragon lair
  - Descending dungeon getting colder and colder, darker and darker
  - Boss fight with a blind ice creature that uses vibrations in the ground to locate and attack Yldra
  - Recieves ice breath weapon (a piece of wisdom handed down from Frostfang) and massive health buff
 
Adjacent Biomes:
- Forest
- Human Empire
- Grasslands
- Gulf

#### Gulf:
Home to the Sea dragons of steam. Sea dragons seem very foreign, even to other dragons, and also considered to be quite optimistic as well as intelligent about the ways of the world. They're quite reserved, however, and absolutely love the taste of wood. The ancient dragon ancestor who lived here was named Bakunawa.

Gulf enounters/locations:
- Must use good timing to avoid the tides
- Sea dragon lair
  - Boss fight with swimming creature that pops out of numerous water holes (actually tubes connected to the ocean) in the ground and attacks
  - Recieves steam breath weapon (a piece of widom handed down from Bakunawa) and massive health buff
 
Adjacent Biomes:
- Grasslands
- Mountains
- Tundra

#### Volcano:
The volcano biome is known by the Dragons as the Eastern Hearth, while it's known by the humans as Desolation Mountain. 

Home to the Red dragons of fire. They are the noble dragons, the most powerful. They are the most removed from other dragons, very secluded and therefore have become the most mythical and mysterious dragons in the eyes of the humans. Because humans fear what they don't know, Red dragons are usually regarded as evil, torturous, and brooding in their homes where rivers flow with lava. This, however, was not the case. The ancient dragon ancestor who lived here was named Rethlox.  

Volcano enounters/locations:
- Must climb the side of the volcano (not very hard) while avoiding falling rocks and debris that the volcano is spewing out (quite hard)
- When reach top of volcano, beginning of the END sequence
 
Adjacent Biomes:
- Mountains

## Events and Interactions

### Introduction
A young wyrmling named Yldra was sent out by their mother to gather Willow for dinner (the purple dragons are omniverous) and is on their way home. This is the opening scene - Yldra flying low above the **forest** biome. They then descend into their mother's "lair" / cave and enters. Yldra's mother is sick, and bathing in a mud pool so that only their head is poking out. Their head lays, with no energy, on the edge of the pool.

![mother0](https://github.com/Luca-Skyline/fantasy-game-2024/blob/43e29cb6798a5024d2289eb518944c02e4452e75/story/dialog_trees/Mother0.drawio.png)

There's some unexpected guests that followed Yldra - the young Dragon must not have been quite careful enough when he was out and about.

A hunting party of two dozen adventurers, ever thirsty for dragon treasure come running through the entry passage, flooding the room and surrounding the dragons, making unintelligble jests in the human language. Yldra knows enough, though, to know they're not getting out of there alive. Knowing that they must protect their son, Yldra's mother tells the baby Dragon:

> "Go, Yldra! Get out through the back tunnel and fly to the Eastern Hearth: the **tallest peak in a land of fire**. There's a friend there, and you'll be safe. I'll find you there."

(This is a reference to the volcano biome (see above)). 
On their way out of the cave, Yldra encounters a heroic adventurer from the land of men named Stragnar Lightningmore. The player is given a short tutorial on their character as they enter combat with Stragnar but inevitably loses for the player has little in the way of the power or might. They are able to escape, but barely. They find a place to hide nearby and wait to see their mother defeat the party, but agonizing roars are not a good a sign. Not long after the flashes of Yldra's mother's breath weapon subside, the band of adverturers emerge from the cave, before fleeing into the forest. The wound on Yldra's wing means they can't fly, so they must navigate the forest on foot.

Following the beginning scene:
The player is given back control over their character and may go anywhere they wish. If they head back into the cave and have audio on, they hear their mother's voice echoing in distant chambers: "Eastern Hearth. Tallest peak in a land of fire."

Choosing to go North will lead to the player transitioning into the Tundra. The player cannot go far East because of the sea. The player can head South and will encounter a human road (which they can follow in either direction). At this point they can continue South and will encounter Secret Lake or Tio Town. 

If they chose to go East (most likely) they soon reach a small clearing with a lake. There, they find a small "psuedodragon" named Xandrelix who has come from the North in search of help.
