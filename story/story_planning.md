# Music Based World

## Idea 1: Sssymphony

A vibrant and almost cartoony world filled with pastel colors and cheery animal characters but you play as a greyscale snake, a stark contrast to the scenes of the world. In this world, you have been tasked with bringing the tunes and songs of your village to the castle of the king of this continent, one of the most brilliant composers of the entire world, a wolf duely named Amadeus. However, along your path, you are faced with the obstacles of many different animals, all of which believe that snakes can't make music as they don't have arms and legs to even play anything! Will you be able to make your way to play your piece for the king himself? Or will you succumb to the criticism and pressure of everyone around you? Whatever it may be, it's all up to you to be able to find your own music.
