# 3D Art Planning
## Calvin to-do list:
#### Primary dragon character
- Capability to be scaled in size as it grows with new "mature" features coming in thoughout the game
- Animations including walk, run, fly, soar, dive, barrel roll, roar, breath attack, crouch??, claw attack, tail attack, injured, subtle talking
#### Primary human "hero" antagonist
- Very heroic looking, with very good armor and his sword is magical
- Animations including walk, shoot (bow and arrow), 2+ sword attacks, 2+ arcane spells cast with hand motions or a wand, an extended shield block, injury / knocked down animation and get up animation. Also basic subtle mouth movement for talking/jesting.
#### Human NPCs (primary basic enemies - these won't be ordinary commoners most/all of the time)
- perhaps 2 or 3 different levels of difficulties and appearances as they will be the primary basic enemies in the world. For instance a traveler (basic), a guardsman, an archer, and a swordsman. Need basic walking and attacks.
#### Several (3-4) other minor bosses, examples of which:
- Other entities of nature that could have taken up dragon lairs as their home (NOT DRAGONS THOUGH) like the bat thing you were talking about or something else
- A wizard or mage of some sort
- A flying human ship
- A reanimated dragon of bones
- etc.

### World assets:
#### Cave/lair
- We need the capability to create several cave systems to match the dragon theme.
- Either design 6 unique cave/lair systems OR
- create say a number of generic chamber and tunnel prefabs that can be linked and connected to create unique cave layouts

#### Human encampment 
- Like a monster camp in other games, but with humans. We need:
- Tent prefab
- Campfire (wood) prefab
- etc.

#### Terrain props:
- 8+ rock models
- 10+ tree models
- 10+ Bush/undergrowth
- 4+ repeatable vertical cliff models that can be arranged to create steps in the world elevation or narrow canyons
- Long grass (could also fall under 2D...)
- Capability to build a city or town:
  - 5-6 small homes
  - City wall prefab which can be duplicated to encircle the town
  - Some variant of the humanoids from earlier which can be going about their business on the streets
  - we don't inside buildings (the dragon isn't going in there) but we do need outsides since the protagonist will surely find themselves led into (or see from above) a human town for _some_ reason.
- tons more
