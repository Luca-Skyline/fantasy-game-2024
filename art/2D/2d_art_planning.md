# 2D Art

## Connor to-do list:
- Button
  - Roughly rectangular
  - 3 colors or "tones" for off, hover, and press
- Toggle switch
- In-game UI including:
  - Enemy health bar and boss health bar (can be VERY simple)
  - More to come... (possibly including like an option tree to switch between breath attacks or something idk)


Totally optional if you want for some reason and have extra time:
- Possibly a text font?
- Custom mouse cursor
- etc.
