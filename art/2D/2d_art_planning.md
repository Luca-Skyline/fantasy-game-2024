# 2D Art

## Connor to-do list:
## Check - Resizable window pane
  ## Check - Just means the corners can have detail but the middle part of the edges should be smooth and continuous so that part can be scaled up for our purposes (we'll handle that, just make sure the art fits this requirement)
  ## Check - Can be simple, and most likely plan for this to be a tiny bit semi-transparent though it's not necassary to work that into the art
- Button
  - Roughly rectangular
  - 3 colors or "tones" for off, hover, and press
- Toggle switch
- In-game UI including:
  - Hearts (full, 3/4, half, 1/2, empty) and recharge wheel for attacks/stamina/etc.
  - Enemy health bar and boss health bar (can be VERY simple)
  - More to come... (possibly including like an option tree to switch between breath attacks or something idk)


Totally optional if you want for some reason and have extra time:
- Possibly a text font?
- Custom mouse cursor
- etc.
